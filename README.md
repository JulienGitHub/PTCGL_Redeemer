# PTCGL Python Redeemer

Uses Selenium to redeem codes from the Pok√©mon webpage : pip install selenium

A codes.txt file is needed in the same directory (1 code per line)

Change _username and _password to your own credentials


_username = "USERNAME"


_password = "PASSWORD"


I do not have codes to test, but there's 5% chance this script is working.
